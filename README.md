# Logo Maker üßë‚Äçüé®
Simple text [Logo Maker](https://vite-logo-maker.vercel.app/). Every text can be dragged. You can also change size and color of the text before save it.
I'm using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as bundler.

## Getting Started
To get started running the project locally, please follow the steps below.
First, clone the repository.
`https://github.com/muslimalfatih/logo-maker.git`

## Prerequisite
Node JS version `v16.15.0` or above
Run nvm use to set your nvm Node version to the desired compatibility for this project. If you are not using `nvm`, give it a try. [Why?](https://tecadmin.net/install-nvm-macos-with-homebrew/)
## How To Run
- Run `nvm use` if you have Node JS installed with `nvm` (and you should)
- Run `yarn` to install the packages based on what we have in package.json
- RUn `yarn start` to starting your application
